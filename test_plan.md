# Test Plan â€” Mid Review

## 1. Objective

The goal of this test plan is to verify the validation logic, dynamic HTML generation, and asynchronous data handling (Fetch/AJAX/Axios) for all major roles and features in the FFSD web-based project. The plan ensures that user interactions, data flow, and UI updates function as intended for each module.

## 2. Scope

This test plan covers:
- Form validation using DOM manipulation and JavaScript for all major forms (add/edit branches, employees, companies, sales, orders, complaints, reviews, contact us).
- Dynamic HTML updates (adding, updating, deleting elements in the DOM).
- Asynchronous data handling with Fetch/Axios/AJAX and backend API communication.
- UI and data flow verification across modules for Admin, Company, SalesManager, Salesman, and Customer.

## 3. Test Environment

- **Browser:** Chrome (latest), Edge (latest)
- **Backend Server:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** SQLite (primary), MySQL (secondary, if configured)
- **Operating System:** Windows 10/11
